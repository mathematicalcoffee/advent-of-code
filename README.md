Language: R. Too lazy to learn IO in other languages.

Biggest lesson: don't try to be mathsy smart, just write the for loop :(

|  01 | Really struggled - spent ages trying to do it 'smart' but hours later, the nasty for-loop was the answer :(                                  |
|  02 | Also over-thought this, should have done it a bit 'dumber' and better. (Don't use formulae: just chop the number into bits to determine the lengths!) |
|  03 | phew, managed this one pretty easy                                                                                                           |
|  04 | straightforward but my code was super slow                                                                                                   |
|  05 | spent way too long writing a "reduce overlapping intervals" function but then read another implementation which was way simpler lol          |
|  06 | I enjoyed the story of part 2.                                                                                                               |
|  07 | I hate these beam-splitter ones. And recursive stuff. That was hard, but I made a cute picture. |

Day 7.
