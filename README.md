# 2024

Repeat after me:

> I will quit after X hours and have a life this December.  
> I will quit after X hours and have a life this December.  
> I will quit after X hours and have a life this December.  

I have too much real life to do to sacrifice....(but then why am I not committing to X?)

Language: R. Too lazy to learn IO in other languages.

|  01 | Too much rubbish to read...                                                                                                                  |
|  02 | Was going to do part 2 smart but convinced myself just-in-time to use a dirty dirty for-loop                                                 |
|  03 | regex is the best and you will never convince me otherwise. Also, I can't read :( (thought each newline was a new program)                   |
|  04 | when part 2 and part 1 code are totally different (and none of it particularly good)... and it's only day 4                                  |
|  05 | no particular comments                                                                                                                       |
|  06 | when part 2 takes 5mins to run....didn't think of the smart thing (should make a cool pic for this one)                                      |
