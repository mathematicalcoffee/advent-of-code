All this ascii art and elves makes me want to play nethack...(coffeebug on nethack.alt.org)

You consume deep fried Elvenking. Eating deep fried food made your
fingers very slippery. Your weapon slips from your hands. You feel wide awake!

Language: R. Been a while.

Started a day late. Let's see if I can keep it up.

Struggling a bit remembering how to be an R-soul, very different to being Pythonic.
The data manipulation is stupidly easy once you construct the dataframe (`data.table` is an amazing package, far better
than Pandas). But where in Python you'd just write for-loops and they would be easy to read, the R way is to do
everything vectorised. The nested `*apply` are quite difficult to read.

|  05 | Just cannot work out the smart way to do it, but I'm so close to conceptualising it. Very frustrating. R is not suited to brute-forcing.     |
|  04 | I feel like there is a sweet mathsy way to do part 2 but oh well, bring out the for-loop. Betraying everything R.                            |
|  03 | "Overlaps" logic does my head in for some reason. Took much longer than it should. Part 2 was pleasingly trivial from the part 1 data.table. |
|  02 | I LOVE `data.table`. But also, R lets you do `"5" < 15` without raising exception?!?! (and returns a bool)                                   |
|  01 | imagine that - the function that said it "extracts the last match" doesn't. ✟ ℝ.𝕀.ℙ. ✟                                                      |
